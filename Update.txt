[22-AUG-16 10:33] Set delay of 1000 from  sendcomannd to waitfor in sendconfirmed method

[22-AUG-16 11:00] 
use SetPower instead of SetRadioPower
use setDataRate instead of SetRadioSF

[22-AUG-16 11:23PM]
bring LoRaWAN.ON outside the loop()

[22-AUG-16 11:37PM]
Change WaspLoRaWAN.cpp waitfor method from 4 expected Answer to only 1 expected Answer

[23-AUG-16 02:06PM]
Remove RTC from main program

[23-AUG-16 06:51PM] 
Tested just 1 level deep that WaspLoRaWAN can issue error if command is not good. Change back to normal.

[23-AUG-16 07:16PM]
Change Baudrate in WaspUART.h to 57600 <- Baudrate is already correct

[23-AUG-16 10:16PM]
Add UART_DEBUG in WaspLoraWAN.h and .cpp
in WaspUART.cpp in sendcommand method add
 	USB.print(F("[debug] UART Socket:")); USB.printHex(_uart);


[24-AUG-16 06:35PM]
Add debug in WaspLoRaWAN.cpp parseintvalue method

-----------------------------------------------------------
Revision 6

To do:
1. Delay time from LoRaWAN.ON to JoinABP to SendConfirmed
2. Delay from mac send tx payload --to-- /r/n

[24-AUG-16 07:05PM]
Set RX1 Delay added

[24-AUG-16 07:05PM]
1. Removed Checking payload is a hexadecimal string in sendconfirmed payload
2. sendconfirmed waitfor change to only 1 respond
3. Insert delay in WaspUART.cpp in the waitfor method inside while loop

[24-AUG-16 12:35AM]
1. Set app key

[24-AUG-16 09:35PM]
1.Play around with OTA
2.Set Lora Network Server To public and Network ID to EUI and Network Key to key
3.Change WaspLoraWAN.cpp joinOTAA method waitfor function input to timeout 20000 -> 3000
4. Change timeout to 30,000
5. Add delay in between On, JoinOTAA etc

[24-AUG-16 11:35PM]
1. So happy today I am able to get all the reading from waspmote
2. Take out antenna
3. Configure App-key as usual in conduit for registration of node
4. Configure P&S to have its own App-key by setting it thorugh LoRaWAN.SetAppKey 
5. WaspLoRaWAN and WaspUART copy has been made
6. Change Lora Network Server to public and Network ID EUI to 11.12.13.14 blah
7. Change Network Key too (actually i have already mentioned it previously but who knows)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 7

To do: 
1. Verify whether App-key is really needed if not MIC error will fire
2. Verifiy is it because now it is set to public network (This seems to be it)
3. Now we want to find out why exactly the acknowledge is not responding
4. Delay from mac send tx payload --to-- /r/n

[26-AUG-16 17:05PM]
1. Edit lora-network-server.conf
      log:{
	    xxxxxx,
	    "path":"" to "path":"/var/log/lora-network-server.log",
	    xxxxx
	  }

[26-AUG-16 18:45PM]
Set RX2 data rate and frequency to 869,100,000 and DataRate to 5
Set RX1 Delay Window to 2000 ms (2 seconds)

[26-AUG-16 12:35PM]

1.WaspUART.cpp waitfor method add
            #if UART_DEBUG > 1
                USB.print(F("[debug] _buffer:"));
                USB.println( _buffer, _length);
            #endif

2.WaspLoRaWAN.cpp sendconfirmed method break apart mac tx cnf [payload] and /r and /n and add delay for each of these

3.WaspLoRaWAN.cpp sendconfirmed method. The easiest way is actually just to add a delay of 5000 after mac tx cnf <port> <data> sendcommand function. What is happening is actually to give time for base station to respond. Of course I could play around with RX1Delay to set how fast I want to send my packet back

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 8

Todo:
1. I want to find out what is actually causing the serial not to get data. Where is the breaking point?

[27-AUG-16 06:24PM]
1. Tested with revision 8 but it does not seems to work again.

[27-AUG-16 07:15PM]
1. Set retries to 2

[27-AUG-16 23:29PM]
I dont know what I did but it sort of work again. This time I have saved all the necessary file that is needed to make it to work. This include WaspLoRaWAN.cpp/.h and WaspUART.cpp/.h in revision 7 folder.

I have verified that even though I setup conduit not to return mac_rx ACK, P&S still is able to read the ACK message

Now there is several things that could cause the UART not receiving again. The following is a list that I can think of (even the crazy one):

1. mac tx cnf [port] [data] in WaspLoRaWAN.cpp need to be broken apart
2. Conduit or Libelium need to warm up
3. The delay of 0.5 sec might be affecting it
4. The ACK function need to return mac_rx 1 AC instead of only AC or ACAF
5. Conduit has been restarted
6. Lease time expired
7. Conduit need to be logged out and log in again in for the whole shebang to be reset to initial state. This means that Conduit has still not synced with P&S. I happen to stumble upon "authorization" / "sync" and conduit is like sending 4 packet of downlink command, but I did not manage to crack it.

[27-AUG-16 23:59PM]
I have tried restarting the conduit while P&S is in off state and when conduit has finished loading its thing, I powered up P&S. It just works to receive the UART command.

[28-AUG-16 09:43PM]
Keep track of ACK by introducing another boolean variable

[28-AUG-16 09:53PM]
Keep track of the Frame counter
